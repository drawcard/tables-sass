# Tables-Sass
### Simple Table Styling with some Sass

Tables-Sass is a collection of simple image styling adapted from [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

## How It Works

Inside `/scss` you owill find both `tables.scss` and `_tables.scss`. This is simply for convenience if you wish to include Tables-sass as a scss partial.

You can also find the compiled, minified version of Tables-Sass in `css/tables.css`.

Getting started with Tables is really easy. [View the online tutorial](http://jwebcat.github.com/tables-sass/) or dig through the `index.html` file or `/demo`.
